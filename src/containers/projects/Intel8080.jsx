              An emulator for the Intel 8080 CPU, released in 1974. Emulates all the registers,
              opcodes, and interrupt pins.

            <p>
              During my sophomore year of high school, I started to be interested in emulators
              through my project to create a Gameboy Classic emulator for my calculator (a project
              that can be found on this site). This project inspired me to step by and work on a
              more common and well defined CPU to try to emulate it properly and get a handle on the
              organization of emulators.
            </p>

            <p>
              I got the idea to pursue an emulator of the Intel 8080 chip by reading the book Code:
              The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, in which the author describes
              the inner workings of the 8080. The elegance of its insides inspired me to pull up the
              Intel manual and read more about the opcodes and registers. Through this, I decided
              that I wanted to give emulating this CPU a shot.
            </p>

            <p>
              So after reading through the manual repeatedly, I felt confident enough to tackle
              actually writing the code. To do this I decided that I wanted to write it in C, simply
              so that I had more experience in the language. I started off by writing the main loop
              and basic registers and immediately decided that for each module and opcode that I
              wrote, I would write multiple tests. This was a huge lesson that I learned from my
              last attempt at writing an emulator which quickly got out of hand with bugs and
              unreadable code.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the help of the 8080 manual and hours of staring at the CPUâ€™s pin diagrams, I
              completed my emulator, properly emulating everything on the CPU except limiting the
              clock speed (a generally tedious exercise, having tried it before).
            </p>

            <Text type="headline4">Takeaways</Text>

            <p>
              Through this project I learned a load hard skills like C, proper testing, and, very
              importantly, an understanding of assembly (despite it being from forty years ago). I
              also came away with a lot of soft skills like proper code organization and writing a
              project so that it can scale to thousands more lines of code.
