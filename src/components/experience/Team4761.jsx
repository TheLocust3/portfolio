              <p>
                I joined my high schoolâ€™s robotics team during my freshman year of high school,
                called the Reading Robockets (or Team 4761, the number that FIRST robotics lovingly
                assigned to us). We were a part of FIRST of FIRST Robotics Competition, a non-profit
                dedicated to inspiring kids to pursue STEM careers through having them create people
                sized robots to solve challenges and generally bash into other robots. The catch was
                that the challenge changed every year and we had an intense six weeks to build a
                robot to complete it.
              </p>

              <p>
                I joined as a programmer and decided day one that this was the team for me. After
                programming the robot the first year, I became the Programming team lead, and
                brought Scrum, which I had learned at my internships, to my team. We divided our
                schedule into Sprints and had daily standups. In the end of that season, we went to
                Worlds, the massive final robotics competition with over five hundred teams and a
                hockey arena filled with a cheering audience.
              </p>

              <p>
                After my sophomore year, I was promoted to Technical Project Manager. In this role,
                I worked as a manager, creating schedules, running daily standups, and keeping the
                team on track. Having this job was an incredibly valuable experience for me because
                it gave me a wide understanding of what it takes to run a team and communicate
                effectively.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally in my senior year, I was elected Technical President. As Tech President, I
                oversaw the team as a whole and worked as the project manager. We faced significant
                challenges that year with many conflicts between the team leadership and our adult
                mentors, but in the end it taught me a ton about managing up and working through
                difficult personal issues with people.
              </p>

              <p>
                Team 4761 shaped the person I am today. Through the good times and the bad, I grew
                as a programmer, a leader, and a person. I learned how to work on a large project
                with a group of 50 people and in the end, how to manage those 50 people and keep
                them motivated through the ups and downs. The Robockets changed me in ways I'll
                never forget.
